        <p>SYNTHESIZER & PCB DESIGN</p>
        <p>
          As well as software development I also have a deep passion for
          combining hardware with software. This mostly takes the form in
          creating and designing synthesisers (electronic musical instruments).
          <br /><br />
          The majority of these instruments are built using C++, the Mozzi audio
          library, low cost Arduino development boards, and analog electronic
          circuits.<br />
          The designs of which I make open source (available via my blog and
          GitHub) and also publish instructions of how to make them for
          beginners.
          <br /><br />If I make a small run of units, I'll often create PCBs
          using the Kicad software. <br /><br />
          You can see a video example of the string synth here

        <p>HELIOS ONE SYNTH</p>
        <p>An Easy To Build Mono Synth</p>
        <p>
          I wanted to design an instrument that was easy to build, cheap to
          make, and also fully playable and expressive. The result was the
          Helios Mk One synth, which is possible to build for around $20.
          Contructed using an Arduino Nano (programmed using C++) and the Mozzi
          audio library, you can build a simple MIDI controlled mono synth with
          a Filter, LFO and ADSR.
          <br /><br />
          The code is open source, and a fully illustrated build guide is
          available. Many people have gone on to build this synth as their
          introduction to synth DIY after it was posted in Hackaday. Some have
          gone on to modify the code and add extra functions.<br /><br />
          You can watch some video examples of the synth here and read about the
          code and build process here.

        <p>ARDUINO SAMPLING DRUM PAD</p>
        <p>Arduino Drum Pad With Build Guide</p>
        <p>
          These drum pads allow you to upload your own audio samples and then
          trigger them using the drum pads. One potentiometer allows you to
          control the pitch of the sample, while the other control the volume.
          The switch allows you to choose between 2 samples (more is not
          possible due to the tiny memory size of the hardware). The drums were
          built using the Mozzi audio library and an Arduino nano.<br /><br />
          You can see a video example of the drum pads in action here. Or read
          the full construction guide here.

        <p>SLEEP MEDITATION MACHINE</p>
        <p>Dodow Clone</p>
        <p>
          With this machine you sync your breathing to the pulse of the LEDs,
          which gradually slow down over either a user selectable 15 or 30
          minute runtime. At the end of the cycle, hopefully you'll be relaxed
          enough to fall asleep.<br /><br />
          Instructions for this build were published to Intructables where it
          was entered for their Arduino Contest 2017.
